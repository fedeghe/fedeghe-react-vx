## install

`yarn add @fedeghe/react-vx`

_@fedeghe/react-vx_ is an attempt to unify the lessons learned writing _@fedeghe/react-vtable_ and _@fedeghe/react-vgrid_.  

The basic idea is to use smarter approaches that allow to make the whole codebase cleaner and the execution faster while handling both cases through one single `mode` parameter and allow to consudme exactly the same config file.  

WIP: clearly this Readme is just a bit more than a placeholder.
